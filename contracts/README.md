# Contracts

Repository-level contract snapshots and validators.

## Runtime API

1. `runtime-http.openapi.v0.yaml`
2. Structural + example validation remains in the runtime repository (`anolis`).

## Composer Control API

1. `composer-control.openapi.v1.yaml`
2. Validator: `python3 contracts/validate-composer-control-openapi.py`
3. Baseline: `../docs/contracts/composer-control-baseline.md`

## Handoff Package

1. Validator: `anolis-validate <package.anpkg>` (or `python3 contracts/validate-handoff-packages.py <package.anpkg>`)
2. Baseline: `../docs/contracts/handoff-package-baseline.md`
3. v1 format spec: `../docs/contracts/handoff-package-v1.md`

## Upstream locks

`upstream/anolis/*.lock.json` pin the three schemas vendored from `anolishq/anolis`.
`upstream/providers/*.lock.json` pin each provider's `--config-schema` envelope.

Nothing here is packaged: the wheel ships the `anolis_workbench` package plus
`schemas/**`, `templates/**` and `frontend/dist/**`, and `contracts/` is
repo-root — so a lock file cannot reach a target host.
These are the vendoring-time record of where each vendored file came from.

### The provider registry

`upstream/providers/` **is** the provider registry: one lock per kind, and the
single declaration of which providers the workbench vendors. Both schema
scripts and CI discover kinds by globbing it, so adding a provider is a data
change, not a code change.

Two invariants, enforced by `verify-upstream-schema.py --all-providers` (CI) and
by `tests/unit/test_provider_locks.py` (every test run):

- Locks and vendored envelopes correspond **1:1**. A lock with no envelope is a
  kind nothing offers; an envelope with no lock is a kind whose provenance is
  unrecorded.
- Each lock agrees with the envelope it vendored — same `provider_version`, and
  `distribution.templates` must re-render the asset names the lock pinned.

The set of kinds the workbench **offers at runtime** is still the set of
vendored envelopes under `anolis_workbench/schemas/providers/`, which is what
ships in the wheel. The 1:1 invariant is what keeps the two in step.

### Adding or updating a provider

```bash
# Onboard a kind that has no lock yet
python3 scripts/sync-upstream-schema-from-release.py \
    --new-provider foo --repo vendor/anolis-provider-foo --tag v0.1.0

# Update one that already has a lock (repo and asset names come from the lock)
python3 scripts/sync-upstream-schema-from-release.py --schema provider-config-foo --tag v0.2.0

# Verify everything
python3 scripts/verify-upstream-schema.py --all-providers --require-release-artifact
```

Asset names default to the convention
`anolis-provider-<kind>-{version}-config-schema.json` (plus a
`-manifest.json` sidecar). A vendor who names assets differently passes
`--asset-template` / `--manifest-asset-template` **once** at onboarding; the
patterns are stored in the lock and every later sync reads them back.

### Lock `schema_version`

| Version | Applies to | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `upstream/anolis/*` | `source`, `distribution.{mode,release,schema_sha256,asset_sha256}` |
| 3 | `upstream/providers/*` | v2 plus top-level `kind` and `provider_version`, and `distribution.templates.{asset,manifest_asset}`. Provider locks also carry `distribution.asset_format: "raw"`, which they had at v2. |

**v2 → v3 migration** (providers only): add `kind` (must equal the filename
stem before `-config-schema.lock.json`), add `provider_version` copied from the
vendored envelope, and add `distribution.templates` — the asset-name patterns
with the version replaced by `{version}`. Re-running the sync for that kind
produces a v3 lock directly. The anolis locks stay at v2: they are a fixed set
of three, not a registry.
