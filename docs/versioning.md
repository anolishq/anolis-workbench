# Versioning Policy

This document defines versioning for anolis-workbench.

## Scope

- Distribution name: anolis-workbench
- Version source of truth: pyproject.toml project.version
- Release trigger input version must exactly match pyproject.toml

## Scheme

anolis-workbench uses Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- MAJOR: breaking changes to commissioning workflows, package behavior, or user-facing compatibility expectations
- MINOR: backward-compatible feature additions
- PATCH: backward-compatible bug fixes, stability improvements, dependency updates, and release pipeline hardening

## Compatibility Boundaries

Runtime compatibility is not encoded only by the workbench package version.
Compatibility with runtime/provider behavior is governed by locked contract artifacts, including:

- anolis_workbench/schemas/runtime-config.schema.json
- anolis_workbench/schemas/machine-profile.schema.json
- contracts/runtime-http.openapi.v0.yaml

Changes to those contracts must follow contract governance and drift checks.

## Release Rules

A release is accepted only when all of the following are true:

1. Requested version is valid semver
2. Requested version equals pyproject.toml project.version
3. Target tag (v<version>) does not already exist
4. Reusable CI gate passes
5. Build artifacts are created successfully
6. PyPI publish succeeds (OIDC trusted publishing)
7. Clean-install smoke checks pass

GitHub release creation occurs only after publish and smoke checks pass.

## Pre-release

The release workflow supports a prerelease toggle for GitHub Release metadata.
Pre-release handling still requires valid semver input and the same quality gates.

## Practical Bump Guidance

Use PATCH for:

- bug fixes
- CI/release reliability improvements
- packaging correctness fixes
- non-breaking dependency updates

Use MINOR for:

- new Compose, Commission, or Operate capabilities that remain backward compatible
- new user-visible workflows without breaking existing ones

Use MAJOR for:

- incompatible behavior changes in core commissioning flows
- removals or changes that require user migration

## Notes

- Keep version increments intentional and small.
- Avoid mixing unrelated large changes into one release when possible.
- Always verify release notes and artifact contents before broad announcement.
